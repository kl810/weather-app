## Overview
This Weather-Forecast-App allows users to get the weather forecast for any city around the world. The features include current date and time, current temperature and other information (UVI, humidity, wind), hourly forecasts (temperature, humidity, wind) and a weekly temperature forecast. The hourly forecasts are displayed visually through line charts and bar charts using Chart.js for improved UX.
